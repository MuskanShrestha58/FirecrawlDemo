# Tried out different ways Firecrawl provides for scraping 
<b>Scraping Issues:<b> Used scrape_url for basobas.com; data retrieved but disorganized. Also tried crawl_url, but it only returned the basic page format without details.
<b> API Endpoints: <b> Tested scrape and crawl on the sale page, but results were not as expected.
<b> LLM Extraction:<b> Structured data well, but struggled with populating all fields in larger schemas, especially with increased max_items.
